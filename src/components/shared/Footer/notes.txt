in the first test, linkElement is a variable (present by default) that is being assigned
the result of the getByText. getbytext is used to find an element in the rendered component
that contains the specified text 

text is given as arg as reg exp with.  '/.../' syntax is used to create regular expression
in js and i means insensitive

In the example, the getByText method is used to find an element that contains the text "Made with" and the variable linkElement is assigned the result.

Then we are using expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument() to check that linkElement is present in the document.


in third test, we use getbytestid to find element with data-testid="..."

note that we have to add data-testid="footer" in actual component in footer to allow
us to select that element with react testing library and then test its properties, classes

for testing module.css classes we have to give the name of class so if its styles.xyz then
we have to test for class xyz
